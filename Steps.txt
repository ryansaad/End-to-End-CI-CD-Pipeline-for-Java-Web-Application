Setup and Installation Guide
This guide will walk you through setting up the Jenkins server, configuring tools, and running the CI/CD pipeline. The Java application code is sourced from a public repository, with the focus of this project being the pipeline itself.

Prerequisites
An operating system capable of running Jenkins (e.g., Ubuntu Linux).
Git installed.
Docker Engine installed and running (for SonarQube container).
A running Jenkins instance (ensure it has sufficient resources, especially for builds with multiple tools).
An active Docker Hub account (if you were to re-enable the Docker build and push stages).
A SonarQube server instance running (e.g., run SonarQube in a Docker container using sudo docker run -d --name sonar-server -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community).

Part 1: Setting up the Jenkins Server and Core Tools (On your Ubuntu Server)
Prepare your Ubuntu Server:
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y wget curl unzip gnupg lsb-release
Install Java (OpenJDK 17):
Bash

sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk
java -version # Verify installation, you should see 'openjdk version "17.0.x"'

Install Jenkins:
Bash
refer to installation guide on this website
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/

Initial Jenkins Setup (Web UI):
Access Jenkins at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080.
Get initial admin password: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
Paste password, install suggested plugins, create admin user, save URL.

Install Docker:
Bash

refer to installation guide on this website 
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

sudo docker run hello-world # Verify
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins # Add jenkins user to docker group
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo systemctl restart jenkins


Install Maven:
Bash

sudo apt install -y maven3
mvn -version # Verify


Install SonarQube (as a Docker Container):
Bash

sudo docker run -d --name sonar-server -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community
Wait a few minutes, then access http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:9000.
Log in (admin/admin), change password.
Generate a SonarQube token: Administration > Security > Users > admin user > Tokens. Copy this token immediately!

Install Trivy:
Bash

get installation resourses from this link:
https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.18.3/installation/

trivy --version # Verify

Part 2: Configuring Jenkins Global Tools and Credentials (Jenkins Web UI)
Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins.

Install Required Jenkins Plugins:
Go to Plugins -> Available plugins. Install: Maven Integration plugin, SonarQube Scanner, OWASP Dependency-Check, Docker, Docker Pipeline (if not already installed by "Install suggested plugins"). Restart Jenkins if prompted.

Configure Global Tool Configurations:
Go to Global Tool Configuration.
JDK: Add JDK (Name: jdk17, Install automatically from Adoptium, Version: 17.0.x).
Maven: Add Maven (Name: maven3, Install automatically, latest version).
SonarQube Scanner: Add SonarQube Scanner (Name: sonarscanner, Install automatically, latest version).
OWASP Dependency-Check: Add (Name: DependencyCheck, Install automatically, Version: 6.5.1 or latest).
Docker: Add (Name: Docker, Install automatically, latest version).

Configure System (SonarQube Server):
Go to Configure System.
Scroll to SonarQube Servers. Click Add SonarQube.
Name: sonar
Server URL: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:9000
Authentication Token: Click "Add" -> "Jenkins". Kind: Secret text. Secret: Paste your SonarQube token. ID: sonar-token. Click "Add". Then select sonar-token from dropdown.
Add Credentials (Docker Hub):
Go to Credentials -> System -> Global credentials (unrestricted) -> Add Credentials.
Kind: Username with password.
Username: Your Docker Hub username.
Password: Your Docker Hub Access key.
ID: docker-cred.
Click "Create".

Part 3: Preparing the Java Application
Fork the Repository: 

Part 4: Creating the Jenkins Pipeline Job
Create New Jenkins Job:
Go to Jenkins Dashboard -> New Item.
Item Name: Give a name (eg.java-web-app-ci-cd).
Select: "Pipeline". Click "OK".
Configure Pipeline Job:
General Tab: Check "Discard old builds", set "Max # of builds to keep" to 2.
Pipeline Tab:
Definition: "Pipeline script".
Script: Paste the following Jenkinsfile content from the Jenkinsfile in the repo.
Hit Build 

part 5 : accessing the application 
Open your web browser.
Navigate to the IP address of your Jenkins server (which is also where the application is deployed).
Access the application on port 8081: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8081
Note: Ensure your server's firewall (e.g., AWS Security Group) allows inbound traffic on port 8081 from your IP address or 0.0.0.0/0 for wider access.
